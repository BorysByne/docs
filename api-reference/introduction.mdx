<Note>
 We are still in beta mode, adding more features and refining existing endpoints. If you plan to use the cloud version for production, please reach out to us to set up a frozen deployment.

## Structure

Our API is structured around the four key verticals: **Connectors**, **Assets**, **Generative endpoints**, and **Knowledge Base management**.

The **Connectors** are pretty empty yet, as we are working on adding ingestion from more sources. We will soon have support for Confluence, but send us requests if you'd like us to add support for a particular data source faster.

**Assets** include all technical entities like Agents and LLMs. If you have your own installation, it will also include management of embedding models and the vector DB.

**Generative endpoints** are, well, a collection of everything you need to generate text, either from Agents or based on a KB.

**Knowledge Base management** includes everything related to the KB, including the knowledge base itself, conversations, and files.
