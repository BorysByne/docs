title: Introduction
description: 'Welcome to Byne! With us, you can build state-of-the-art LLM applications on our platform and then migrate your environment on-premise or into a private cloud.'

## Platform

Is your company primarily operating on-premise or private cloud infrastructure? 
Byne provides a fully-managed service for you to develop RAG and Agents applications. The platform handles everything, from spinning up
a vector DB and ingesting documents to processing function calls from Agents. We estimate that about 65-85% of most popular use cases (knowledge management apps, document processing)
can be implemented in under 50 lines of code using Byne. And most importantly, applications developed on this platform are entirely vendor-agnostic. 
You can migrate the completed app into your private cloud, to a preferred IaaS provider, or even on-premise. Apps built with Byne don't rely on external services and can be deployed on any infrastructure.

## Get started

We provide a UI (that's also migratable) for you to experiment with different setups. There, you can also create a key to start using the API.
To create an API key, navigate to the "Sign Up" page and register with the service. Your personal profile is accessible by clicking the "My profile" button.
Once inside your profile, click the "For Developers" tab to navigate to the developer panel.

In the "For Developers" panel, you may create an API key to use our services. Save it since the API key can only be viewed once for security reasons!

Once you have the API key, you may authorize your requests by simply adding an HTTP Header "X-API-Key" with your key to each request. Please refer to the "API Reference" section to learn more about the available tools.

## Pricing

We don't make money from the cloud playground so we only recharge the costs by using API credits. One API unit costs 1c (0.01\$). We charge 3 units (0.03\$) per call to parse a document (per document in a triggered Job) and 2 units (0.02\$) per generation (/ask endpoint call).
